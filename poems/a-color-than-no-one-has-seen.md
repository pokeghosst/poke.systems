Last night I had a dream
About a color that no one has seen.
I try to explain it -- alas, in vain.
But I have to do this or I'll go insane!

I try to draw it but nothing comes out.
I would write a poem but where do I start?
The color wheel can only offer so much.
What is there to do when there's no color of such?

Running in circles, a usual theme --
Looking for words to expound a dream.
Trying for nothing, a pitiful scene:
Describing a color that no one has seen.
