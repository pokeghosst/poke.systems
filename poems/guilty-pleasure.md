The pleasure is mine
And only mine
I won’t let anyone pry
To make me feel guilty
For doing what I love

They come up with what’s normal and not
Labeling things as good or bad
But who gave them the right to decide?
Who says their moral compass
Is straighter than mine?

I will keep my little hobbies
Behind a big gate
The entrance is invite only!
And you’re not invited
