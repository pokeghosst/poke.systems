I draw roads on an empty map
They lead to destinations close and far
Some of them end abruptly
Others are nice and long
Some are straight highways
Others are tiny local streets
At first I was nervous
My hand was trembling
And lines were jagged
But the more I drawn the better it got
And the more I wanted to draw
Sometimes I wonder
What will happen
When there is no space
Left on the map
