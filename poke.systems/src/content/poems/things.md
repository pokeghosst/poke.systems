I like things.
Small things,
Big things,
Old things,
New things.

I like to keep them.
I like to look at them.
I like to hold them.
They are my little toys—
I like to play with them.

Sometimes I break them.
Sometimes I fix them.
Sometimes I throw them out.
But I appreciate them all regardless.

They fill the void in my soul.

It’s my collection of things.
Small things.
Big things.
Old things.
New things.
I like my things.

My collection is big,
Yet there’s one little thing,
One little toy
That I couldn’t get my hands on.
One thing I want to break so much—
Your heart,
Because you owe me mine.
