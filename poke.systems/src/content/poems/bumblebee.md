I want to pet a bumblebee
Is that too much to ask?
It's round and soft and actually
This is an easy task

I want to pet a bumblebee
And put it on my palm
Then show the world it'd never see
Protect it from the harm

I want to pet a bumblebee
But it's a bit too small
Besides, I know it'd sting me
If I approached at all

I want to pet a bumblebee
That's all I could have asked
But it's not really possible
It's not an easy task
