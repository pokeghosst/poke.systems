Nothing ventured, nothing gained;
Nothing done and nothing planned;
Nothing said and nothing thought;
Nothing taken, nothing brought.

Doing anything? No thanks.
Doing means that I will fail.
Doing things requires change.
Doing means things rearrange.

I would rather stay in place.
Doing nothing is okay.
Stable is a place to be.
I enjoy it, can't you see?

You can go and chase your dream,
If it makes you feel supreme.
I will be where I belong,
Where I have been all along.
