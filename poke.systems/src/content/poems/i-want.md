I want the hand that you hold to be mine.
I want the side that you’re on to be mine.
I want the shoulder you cry on to be mine.
I want the place where you stay to be mine.

I want the person you hang out with to be me.
I want the person you play games with to be me.
I want the person you share secrets with to be me.
I want the person you ask for help to be me.

I want the hand that I hold to be yours.
I want the smile that I see to be yours.
I want the voice that I hear to be yours.

But I don’t know you.
